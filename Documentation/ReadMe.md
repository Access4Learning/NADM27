# This folder is empty

This folder is empty because the official version is here:
https://github.com/nsip/specgen/tree/master/Documentation

This is a documentation of the SpecGen code itself, not the input files. This project is for the NA 2.7 Plus project and hopefully will not involve changes to the SpecGen code. If this is the case, then changes in this project will be integrated into the SpecGen project here:
