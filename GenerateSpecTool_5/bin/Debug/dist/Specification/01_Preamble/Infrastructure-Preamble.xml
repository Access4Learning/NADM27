		<em>This release of the SIF Data Model is effectively a major release in that it makes changes to the data model that reach the level of impact of a major release. Also, some features of the SIF 2.* Infrastructure have been deprecated. Please see Section 2.4 of this document for more detail.</em>

	<Section name="Abstract">
		<Section name="What is SIF?">
			<p>The Schools Interoperability Framework (SIF) is not a product, but a technical blueprint for enabling diverse
		applications to interact and share data related to entities in the pK-12 instructional and administrative environment.  SIF is designed to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Facilitate data sharing and reporting between applications without incurring expensive customer development costs;</li>
				<li>Enhance product functionality efficiently; and</li>
				<li>Provide best-of-breed solutions to customers easily and seamlessly.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The SIF Implementation Specification defines:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>an XML-based messaging framework that allows diverse software applications to interoperate and share and report data related to entities
			in the pK-12 instructional and administrative environment;</li>
				<li>an HTTP(S)-based transport for conveying these SIF messages;</li>
				<li>An alternative SOAP-based transport and corresponding set of WSDL files which allow web services to fully participate in these interactions; </li>
				<li>an abstract, platform-independent definition of a message queue for reliable delivery of asynchronous SIF messages and related synchronous
			administrative functions&#x2014;the <em>Zone Integration Server (ZIS)</em>; and</li>
				<li>an abstract, platform-independent definition of the interface between a software application and the ZIS&#x2014;the <em>SIF Agent</em>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These are known collectively as the <em>SIF Infrastructure</em>. The SIF Implementation Specification also defines the <em>SIF Data Model</em>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>an XML-based data model that models entities in the pK-12 environment as <em>SIF Data Objects</em> to be shared between applications.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>A <em>SIF Zone</em> is a distributed system that consists of a ZIS and one or more software applications 
		with a SIF Agent (a <em>SIF-enabled application</em>) sharing/reporting one or more SIF data objects over a network.  
		A <em>SIF Implementation</em> consists of one or more SIF Zones deployed and configured to meet customer data sharing and reporting needs.
		</p>
			<p>
		The SIF Implementation Specification defines architecture requirements and communication protocols for software components and the interfaces
		between them; it makes no assumption of specific hardware or software products needed to develop SIF-enabled applications and Zone Integration Server implementations, 
		other than their ability to support technologies leveraged as the foundation for SIF, most prominently XML and HTTP(S).

		<Section name="Schools Interoperability Framework Association">
			<p>The Schools Interoperability Framework Association (SIF Association) is an industry initiative to enable interoperability and data sharing between
		software applications in the pK-12 instructional and administrative environment, and the forum for companies and educators to participate 
		in the development of SIF specifications in the SIF Association's working groups and task forces.  The SIF Association is designed to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Join industry leaders in creating the next-generation framework for education technology; and</li>
				<li>Leverage co-marketing opportunities with partners and distributors.</li>
			</ul>

	<Section name="Certification and Compliance Claims">
		<p>
        Though a product may be demonstrated to comply with this specification, no product may be designated as 
        <em>SIF Certified&#x2122;</em> by an organization or individual until the product has been tested against and
        passed established compliance criteria, published separately <a href="References.html#SIFCertification">[SIFCertification]</a>.  
				Organizations and individuals that are currently paying annual membership dues to the SIF Association 
        and dedicating resources to the initiative may also use the designation
        <em>SIF Participant</em> to describe their involvement with the SIF Association and SIF in marketing, public relations and other materials.
