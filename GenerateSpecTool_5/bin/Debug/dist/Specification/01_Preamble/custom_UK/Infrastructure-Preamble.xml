		<Section name="Certification and Compliance Claims">
      <p>
        Though a product may be demonstrated to comply with this specification, no product may be designated as 
        <em>SIF Certified&#x2122;</em> by an organisation
        or individual until the product has been tested against and
        passed established compliance criteria, published separately <a href="References.html#SIFCertification">[SIFCertification]</a>.  
				Organisations and individuals that are currently paying annual membership dues to the SIF Association 
        and dedicating resources to the initiative may also use the designation
        <em>SIF Participant</em> to describe their involvement with the SIF Association and SIF in marketing, public relations and other materials.
