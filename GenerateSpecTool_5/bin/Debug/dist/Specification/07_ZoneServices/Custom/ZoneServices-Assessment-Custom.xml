	<p>The Assessment Services define the role of the assessment scoring system within the overall assessment process.  The service interfaces encapsulate a process choreography and a set of data exchanges that are not restricted to object-level Request/Response or Change Event messages.  They utilize the existing SIF Data Model with no extensions.  </p>
	<Section name="Student Assessment Process">
		<p>There are three different systems that are involved in scoring a student assessment. </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Online Assessment System (OAS)</li>
			<li>Assessment Processing System (APS)</li>
			<li>Student Information System (SIS)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The assessment process is designed to decouple these systems in time, so that no one system can block another. In brief, the choreography of the assessment process is:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The Online Assessment System Service (<code>serviceAssessmentAdministration</code>) gives assessments to students and collects their responses.</li>
			<li>These responses are documented in a StudentResponseSet and sent, via a ServiceInput message to the Assessment Processing System Service (<code>serviceAssessmentProcessing</code>).  A ServiceOutput message back to the OAS confirms their reception and acceptance.</li>
			<li>The APS adds ItemScores to the StudentResponseSet responses.  These scored responses are then reported to the Online Assessment System via a ServiceInput message.  A ServiceOutput message back to the APS confirms their reception and acceptance.</li>
			<li>The Online Assessment System uses these responses to create StudentScoreSets for the test and its psychological constructs.  When complete, it issues an AdministrationScored Service Notification message to its subscribers informing them of the availability of the new student scores.</li>
			<li>The Student Information System or any other subscribers to this OAS notification can then chose to issue a targeted Request message with the DestinationId set to the SourceId of the AdministrationScored Notification message (the OAS is usually the Assessment Object Provider, but it doesn’t have to be).  This Request asks for the completed StudentScoreSets indicated in the notification.  The Response message from the OAS contains them.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The exact system interaction during the assessment process is shown in the Collaboration Diagram below and described more fully in the following subsections.</p>

		<Section name="Process Details">
			<p>Assessment results (responses then scores) for an administration are passed from one Online Assessment System Service to one or more Assessment Processing System Services, and then to a single SIS.  The process flow is difficult to model without using Zone Services to hide the choreography and avoid bending infrastructure rules, since the SIS should not hold scores for any given administration of an assessment until all the related StudentResponseSets and AssessmentItems have been scored. This means the APS needs to be triggered only after all the responses for a given assessment administration have been committed; otherwise it will not know what comprises the complete set.  Having the OAS issue a “ScoreItems” SIF Event wouldn’t be enough because the OAS needs to know that the assessment results have been stored correctly, but Events have no response, whereas ServiceInput requests do.  </p>
		</Section>
		<Section name="Communication of the collected responses to the system(s) responsible for their scoring.">
			<ol>
				<li>The OAS administers an assessment to a set of students, capturing the raw student responses.</li>
				<li>The OAS submits the raw responses to one or more Assessment Processing System Service(s).
					<p>A ServiceInput message for the Assessment Processing System Service is sent to the zone. The request invokes the service operation ScoreItems. This request contains multiple packets of data and includes the AssessmentAdministration object, the raw responses of all of the students that took the assessment, and additional demographic data.  It may or may not include a list of RefIds for the items to be scored by the receiving service.</p>
				</li>
				<li>The ZIS forwards the ServiceInput message to the APS agent that provides the Assessment Processing System Service.</li>
				<li>The APS Service responds with the ScoreItemsResponse packet.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The APS Service issues a ScoreItemsResponse ServiceOutput message which indicates the request was accepted, which the ZIS routes back to the OAS.</p>
		</Section>
		<Section name="Communication of the items' scores 'back' to the OAS.">
			<ol>
				<li>The APS processes the raw responses and calculates scores for each specified item.</li>
				<li>The APS Service issues an ItemsScored ServiceInput message to the OAS that carries the item scores for the targeted responses.  The OAS processes the updated StudentResponseSet to add the ItemScores to its data.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The OAS sends an ItemsScoredResponse ServiceOutput message acknowledging delivery of the scores.</p>
		</Section>
		<Section name="Communication of the scores to the system responsible for reporting.">
			<ol>
				<li>The OAS combines the item scores and calculates score totals for each student.</li>
				<li>The OAS Service publishes an AdministrationScored Service Notification message to the zone which indicates to subscribers that a complete assessment administration has been scored and includes the AssessmentAdministration SIF object.</li>
				<li>The SIS requests the results from the OAS (by equating the SIF_DestinationId to the SIFSourceId of the AdministrationScored Notification ) using a SIF_Request which specifies the AssessmentAdministrationRefId.</li>
				<li>The OAS Service returns the results in a Response message and the SIS stores the results.</li>
