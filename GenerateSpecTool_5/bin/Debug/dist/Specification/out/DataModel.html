This section presents the XML structure for SIF Data Model common elements and objects in a tabular format for readers
less versed in parsing formal XML schema definitions, along with conventions that typically apply in the data model for
easy reference.

    <a name="Format" />
    <h3>3.1.1 Format</h3>
    <p>The Char(acteristics) column for all of the tables in this section use the following codes:</p>

Mandatory elements <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be present in Add events, and
in non-empty and non-error responses to requests for entire SIF objects (e.g., no <code>SIF_Query/SIF_QueryObject/SIF_Element</code> elements supplied in the request).
Mandatory attributes <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> always be present if their corresponding element is present.
</p>
    <p>
SIF Agents and Zone Integration Servers <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> supply data according to the types specified in the Type columns and their corresponding equivalents
in the most recent schema files associated with this specification.  If there is a discrepancy between object and element definitions in this specification and the
corresponding schema files,
the definition in the schema files takes precedence; every effort will be made to note discrepancies in the <a href="errata/1.html">errata</a> for this document as they
are identified.

    <a name="Conventions" />
    <h3>3.1.2 Conventions</h3>
    <a name="ObjectAttributesPrimaryKeys" />
    <h4>3.1.2.1 Object Attributes/Primary Keys</h4>
    <p>
XML attributes in SIF are primarily used to provide additional information regarding the associated element content.  In addition, attributes at the root level of an object can have special significance.  These root-level attributes often serve as the primary key or identifier for the object.  In many cases this is no more than a <code>RefId</code> GUID of <a href="CommonTypes.html#RefIdType"><code>RefIdType</code></a>, though these object key components may consist solely of foreign key references to other SIF objects and include school years, dates, etc.  These object key components (root-level attributes) are immutable over the lifetime of an object and serve the purpose of uniquely identifying an object, especially in <code>Change</code> and <code>Delete</code> events.  Some Working Groups also include non-object key components in object attributes: e.g., mandatory foreign key references to other objects or attributes that provide additional processing information regarding the object.  As SIF currently does not mandate that all object attributes be included in all messages, when a SIF Association Working Group or Task Force places a non-primary key attribute
in the object's attribute definitions (typically out of historical query conventions), they are indicating that this value must still be accessible
to systems in <code>Change</code> and, more notably, <code>Delete</code> events.  Also, all object key component attributes must be supplied to identify the object
in <code>Change</code> and <code>Delete</code> events.
</p>
    <a name="ObjectReferences" />
    <h4>3.1.2.2 Object References</h4>
    <p>
As stated elsewhere, SIF primarily uses GUIDs as object identifiers, primary keys, or <code>RefId</code>s.  References to primary keys (foreign key references)
follow certain conventions in SIF in most objects:
</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	An element or attribute of type <a href="CommonTypes.html#IdRefType"><code>IdRefType</code></a> can be defined that consists of the referenced object name
	concatenated with <code>RefId</code>, e.g., <code>
						StudentPersonalRefId
						
					</code> (a reference to the object identifier/primary key/<code>RefId</code>
	of a <code>
						StudentPersonal
						
					</code> object);
</li>
      <li>
	An element requiring a more descriptive name for the reference or one that refers to more than one object type is defined as <a href="CommonTypes.html#IdRefType"><code>IdRefType</code></a>, has an element name of a group's choosing (or generically <code>SIF_RefId</code>) and enumerates all possible object types that can be referenced
	in the <code>SIF_RefObject</code> attribute; or
</li>
      <li>
	A pair of attributes can be defined, one of type <a href="CommonTypes.html#IdRefType"><code>IdRefType</code></a> containing the referenced object's <code>RefId</code>, the other enumerating
	all possible object types that can be referenced; generically these are named <code>SIF_RefId</code> and <code>SIF_RefObject</code>, respectively;
	naming conventions that programmatically allow identification of the pair beyond the generic names will be documented when the need arises.
</li>
    </ul>
    <a name="ListsRepeatableElements" />
    <h4>3.1.2.3 Lists/Repeatable Elements</h4>
    <p>
For those accustomed to normalized relational databases, the SIF Data Model will appear to be not especially normalized, especially with regard to
repeating groups of data not separated into their own "tables," or in SIF's case, "objects" with primary/foreign keys to maintain the
relationship.  Bear in mind that SIF is not a format for storing
data; it is a format for transmitting data <em>asynchronously</em> between <em>disparate</em> and <em>distributed</em> systems needing to share data for
interoperability; the format this data takes in different systems can vary greatly, and the data related to any given "entity" may
come from a variety of sources and systems.
The goals of normalization—eliminating redundancy, organizing data efficiently, reducing inconsistencies, etc.—take on a different meaning in
a message queuing system.  Of primary importance is transmitting the data needed for interoperability in a minimum number of messages.  The need to "join" together
a great number of separate objects is kept to a minimum in SIF, as individual systems do not have access to all the data required and due to the asynchronous
nature of SIF, any one of these systems may take a fair amount of time before returning data necessary for joins (<code>SIF_ExtendedQuery</code> has been
developed to communicate a join to a single system that may have direct access to the all the data necessary to efficiently accomplish this task).  It's one
thing to make a separate request for a student's picture or enrollment information, another entirely to request every available phone number, address and e-mail
address separately from the SIF Zone.  As such, it is often the case in SIF that repeating data is stored directly in an object, rather than being separated
out into a separate object.
</p>
    <p>
Repeating data is very analogous to objects, though, within any given object.  In SIF's Publish/Subscribe model, repeating elements in objects
can be added to, changed in or deleted from an object, much like objects can be added to, changed in or deleted from a Zone.  Within an existing object, all of these
actions take place within a <code>Change</code> event, and repeating elements—if any exist initially—are first made available within an object in an <code>Add</code>
event or can be obtained directly via requests.  Repeatable elements are contained within a parent <em>List</em> element in most SIF objects
whether or not they support events, e.g.:
</p>
    <a name="Example31231EmailList" />

    <div class="example_parent">
      <div class="example"
>&lt;EmailList&gt;
  &lt;Email Type="Primary"&gt;contact@sifinfo.org&lt;/Email&gt;
  &lt;Email Type="Alternate1"&gt;info@sifinfo.org&lt;/Email&gt;
&lt;/EmailList&gt;
</div>
    </div>
    <span class="caption">Example 3.1.2.3-1: EmailList</span>
    <p>
Two types of list are currently defined in SIF, <em>ActionList</em> and <em>List</em>; both consist of a list container element and a single repeatable
child element.  Each type of list serves different needs and has associated conventions for communication and processing in the SIF Publish/Subscribe Model.
<em>List</em> or <em>ActionList</em> is specified in the Type column in tables in this section for each list; when an <em>ActionList</em> the key, possibly
compound, is also indicated in the Type column. <em>ActionList</em> key values must be unique within an instance of an <em>ActionList</em>.
</p>
    <a name="ActionList" />
    <h5>3.1.2.3.1 ActionList</h5>
    <p>
	An <em>ActionList</em> has a key that uniquely identifies each child element within the list.  This type of list is primarily used when it is
	desirable or necessary for systems to support or refer to a subset of the list, either due to functionally only being able to support a subset
	or because specifying a subset in <code>Change</code> events is more efficient than transmitting a whole list as in <em>List</em>.
	While one system may support the <code>
						Primary
						
					</code>  and
	<code>
						Alternate1
						
					</code>  e-mail address types above, another may additionally support <code>
						Alternate2
						
					</code> addresses.  
	The second system
	is able to communicate the addition, change or deletion of an <code>
						Alternate2
						
					</code> address without 
	the first system inadvertently interpreting
	that to mean a student or staff member's <code>
						Primary
						
					</code>  and <code>
						Alternate1
						
					</code> addresses have been deleted.
</p>
    <p>
	Systems communicate the whole list as a cohesive unit consisting of the parent list container element and all child elements in an <code>Add</code>
	event; if the container is present with no child elements, the list is empty; the same is implied when an optional list is not present in an
	<code>Add</code> event.  In a <code>Change</code> event, systems <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span>  only transmit those elements that have been added, changed or deleted.  Deletion
	is not implied by the omission of a child element, but rather explicitly communicated with a <code>SIF_Action</code> attribute of <code>Delete</code>
	added to the deleted element, along with the element's key attribute(s)/element(s) at a minimum.  An empty list in a <code>Change</code> event implies
	no changes have occurred in the list, as does the omission of the list.  Systems storing <em>ActionList</em> data should set/replace/delete any
	existing values identified by primary keys in the <code>Change</code> event they support.
</p>
    <a name="Example312311IndicatingANewValueForThePrimaryEMailAddressAndDeletingTheAlternate1Address" />

    <div class="example_parent">
      <div class="example"
>&lt;EmailList&gt;
  &lt;Email Type="Primary"&gt;editor@sifinfo.org&lt;/Email&gt;
  &lt;Email Type="Alternate1" SIF_Action="Delete" /&gt;
&lt;/EmailList&gt;
</div>
    </div>
    <span class="caption">Example 3.1.2.3.1-1: Indicating a new value for the Primary e-mail address and deleting the Alternate1 address</span>
    <p>
A system that supports an <code>
					Alternate2
					
				</code> e-mail makes no changes to its value for that address type.
</p>
    <a name="List" />
    <h5>3.1.2.3.2 List</h5>
    <p>
	While a unique, primary key may still be identifiable in its child elements, a <em>List</em> is used primarily when:
</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the list is a cohesive whole conceptually, where supporting or referring to a subset of the list is of little value;</li>
      <li>when the list consists only of keys, and no associated data;</li>
      <li>the list is informational/temporary state information and not typically persisted; or</li>
      <li>when no key exists to uniquely identify items in the list.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <em>List</em>s are always transmitted as a cohesive unit consisting of the parent list container element and all child elements.  If no child
	elements exist in the list, the list consists of the container element alone.  Omission of an optional <em>List</em> in an <code>Add</code> event
	also implies no list items.  In a <code>Change</code> event, omission of the <em>List</em> indicates no changes have been made; otherwise the
	parent container element and all child elements, if any, are included.  Systems storing
	<em>List</em> data should replace all corresponding data in their systems when persisting the list; likewise when a change is made to one or more
	list items or when all items in the list are deleted, systems should send the whole list in a <code>Change</code> event.
</p>
    <p>
	A system that supports <code>CountriesOfCitizenship</code> updates its local data to reflect U.S.
					 and German citizenship.
</p>
    <a name="SupportedOptionalElementsWithoutValues" />
    <h4>3.1.2.4 Supported Optional Elements Without Values</h4>
    <p>
Some agents follow the convention of supplying an optional element as empty (e.g. <code>&lt;BirthDate&gt;&lt;/BirthDate&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;BirthDate/&gt;</code> to indicate
that the application supports the element, but that it currently has no value available within a given object.  To allow for this convention within SIF—as in this example
an empty string does not satisfy the <code>xs:date</code> type definition of <code>BirthDate</code>—all optional elements in SIF
are defined as <code>nillable</code> <a href="References.html#SCHEMA">[SCHEMA]</a>.  To satisfy type constraints on an element while still supplying an empty or "nil"
value, agents <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> tag the element with a <code>true</code> value for the <code>nil</code> attribute from namespace
<code>http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance</code> <a href="References.html#SCHEMA">[SCHEMA]</a> (e.g. <code>&lt;BirthDate xsi:nil="true"/&gt;</code> where the prefix <code>xsi</code> has been mapped to
the namespace <code>http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance</code>), unless an empty value is valid with regard to the element's type definition,
in which case supplying the <code>nil</code> attribute value of <code>true</code> is optional.
See <a href="NotesOnRelatedTechnologies.html#SIFAndXMLNamespaces">SIF and XML Namespaces</a> for more details on namespaces, and <a href="NotesOnRelatedTechnologies.html#SIFAndXMLSchema">SIF and XML Schema</a>
for more details on SIF's use of XML Schema.
</p>
    <a name="ExternallyDefinedXML" />
    <h4>3.1.2.5 Externally-Defined XML</h4>
    <p>
Note that XML not defined within SIF does not necessarily support ad hoc omission of XML elements at will to conform with the conventions of the SIF Publish/Subscribe Model
(where unchanged elements are typically omitted in Change events, and where non-key elements are often omitted in Delete events) or of the SIF Request/Response Model
(where a subset of elements can be retrieved from objects with requests).  If externally-defined XML occurs within a SIF data object, SIF conventions do not
extend to that XML unless that XML is defined to accommodate SIF conventions; the XML, when transmitted, must only conform to any external definitions dictating
its structure, if any.  Applications should be prepared for the possibility of receiving whole externally-defined XML structures in Change events (regardless of how little or much of the external
XML has changed) and possibly also Delete events, likewise in responses even when a subset of the XML structure's child elements may have explicitly been requested.
